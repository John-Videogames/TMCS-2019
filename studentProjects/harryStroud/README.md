Welcome to the game that isn't really a game at all. It's an exposition of coding prowess. Prepare to be mesmerised by not one, but two triangles, which zip around the screen and blur through all possible colours as they do so.

I sincerely hope you enjoy your visual and emotional experience.

From,


Someone who is not terribly good at coding.
