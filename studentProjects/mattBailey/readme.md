A simple 3D game that relies on pyglet.
W, A, S, D move you (not relative to the camera, absolutely -- often called tank controls)

The mouse will look left and right, and clicking can somewhat spottily remove TMCS members
from existence.

Relies on all files in
`./Resources/` directory.

Conda environment is in 
`environment.yml`

Run with 
`./python3 ideal-tmcgas.py`
